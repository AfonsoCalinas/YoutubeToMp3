# Youtube Downloader To MP3

![OS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-%20-9cf) [![Python3.11.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python3.11.3-%20-important)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.3/python-3.11.3-amd64.exe) ![Pytube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pytube%2015.0.0-%20-success)

A program that uses the python library <b>Pytube</b> to download your music from youtube!

To use this program you will have to first install the needed libraries for it:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And I'll leave a link to [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) just in case you don't have it installed, it's really useful!


# How to use üîç

To start the program:
```
python main.py
```

Insert your desired directory, per example:
```
A:\Users\Heisenberg\Desktop\Youtube\output
```

After that, the program will ask you for the youtube link, and here's an example:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0&ab_channel=Duran
```

As of now, you should have your music in your folder!

There is a .txt file (which you can remove once you have the project in your computer) in the output folder, so that Github let's me create these "empty" folders in the project
